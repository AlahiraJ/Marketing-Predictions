OBJECTIVE

The objective of this machine learning project is to predict if the client will subscribe to 
a term deposit by the bank.

CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS:

The criteria for the success of this project would be an achievement of a 
minimum f1 score of 90 percent as we would be more concerned with predicting those
clients who would not subscribe to the term deposits so as to avoid a wastage of time
and resources of the marketing department.

The CRISP-DM methodology which is an industry accepted data science methodology 
would be used. Major phases of this methodology include:   
	Business Understanding - 
	Data Understanding - 
	Data Preparation - 
	Modeling - 
	Evaluation - 
	Deployment

RESULTS:

A logistic regression, random forest and boosting algorithm were used.

1. The binary logistic algorithm produced a model that had an accuracy score of
   83 percent accuracy which did not imporve after hyperparameter tuning with the 
   aid of gridsearch.

2. The Random forest algorithm on the other hand after hyperparameter tuning 
   produced a model which had an precision of 82 percent and a recall score of 86 percent

3. The Adaboosting algorithm was used and it gave a precision score of 89 percent and a 
   recall score of 85 percent
